# C- NARC (Coagulant Nanoparticle Attachment Rate Characterization)
The C-NARC subteam is investigating how the rate of attachment of coagulant nanoparticles to clay particles and the flocculator walls changes over time.  Research conducted by Contact Chamber as well as observations by other teams suggests that the rate of increase of head loss over the length of the flocculator is proportional to the concentration of free coagulant nanoparticles in each section of the flocculator.  By measuring head loss through the flocculator, the team hopes to observe a decrease in the rate of head loss accumulation.
